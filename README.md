## About me 

I'm a Data Analyst at Bloomberg. My group owns the dataset for corporate bonds and preferred shares, which powers the Bloomberg Terminal and other Bloomberg products. My team focuses on collecting and publishing data points that are generated during the lifecycle of the securities (think interest payments, defaults, restructurings).

My team is also responsible of the correct functioning of Bloomberg Analytics on these fixed income instruments. E.g. price/yield, price/discount margin, spreads, risk metrics, trade invoicing etc.

I focus on automating (or sometimes, semi-automating) real-time data ingestion from external sources, e.g. feeds from third party data providers, web crawlers, emails.

## What I'm interested in

- Pricing financial instruments, especially fixed income;
- Functional programming paradigms;
- Epistemology, logics and philosophy of language;
- Semantic data modelling;
- In general, large systems; like train systems or computer clusters.

## My skills

Unfortunately most of the software I write is closed source and proprietary. On this Github youu'll only find half-started side projects, whose repos I created in a fluke of inspiration. However, this is what I normally do in my day job:

- Write Python microservices, deploy them on a proprietary version of Kubernetes;
- Set up the pipework for these microservices, allowing them to consume from and output to message queues similar to Apache Kafka;
- Arrange microservices in a data flow pipeline to create a workflow, sometimes reusing enterprise-available services and sometimes using my custom ones;
- Test, review, design, reiterate.
